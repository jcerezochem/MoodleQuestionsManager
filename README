Tools to manage Moodle quizzes
-------------------------------

extract_questions_new.py:
Extract all questions in question.xml from backup course.
Writes an rst file with the minimal info, that can be used to
check the translation and make fixes on the questions with a
text file (ASCII)
It can be rerun with the revised rst file to generate the final
XML with questions to be imported in Moodle (with option -userev)
In this case, reads the rst file written before
With -genpdf generates tex and pdf files (with pdflatex)

extract_questions_transition.py
Same as above, but also writes a rst file when run with -userev, so 
as to generate a rst file including possible changes to the format


process_question_tex.sh

After doing so, rerun pdflatex to get the right pdf's:

for file in *tex; do ../Tools/fix_question_tex.sh $file; pdflatex $file; done
